<p>This week I removed all advertising on my iPhone apps. Here a short list of why I did it.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ads took the fun out of my hobby</li>
	<li>Not profitable</li>
	<li>Bad user experience</li>
	<li>Time consuming</li>
	<li>More creativity</li>
	<li>I'm not running a business</li>
	<li>Likely to earn more with purchases instead</li>
	<li>Privacy</li>
	<li>Complex code (cocoapods, extra libraries)</li>
	<li>Everyone hates Ads</li>
	<li>I love the old school model where people just bought apps they like</li>
	<li>iOS 14 try before you guy rumors</li>
	<li>Focus on making great apps</li>
	<li>If you build it, they will come</li>
	<li>Ads are misleading and trick people (like spam)</li>
	<li>I don't want to be associated with an industry like that</li>
	<li>I build these apps for me and for my friends - Ads are lame</li>
	<li>Minimalism - it's simpler - less is more</li>
	<li>I was embarrassed to tell friennds about my apps because of the ads</li>
	<li>Zack convinced me it was a good idea. He was right!</li>
</ol>
